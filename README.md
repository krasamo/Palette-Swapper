# Palette Swapper | Penpot Plugin


## What does it do?

Palette Swapper is a [Penpot](penpot.app) plugin that allows you swap a color palette defined in your colors library to another in your designs.
Just select the origin palette and the target palette and watch it do its magic by changing all the colors of the original palette into the ones in the target palette for your current page!


## How to install it?

Open the plugin manager in penpot and write this URL: https://MISSINGURL.com/manifest.json


## How to use it?

*This usage example will be based in the "Mastodon app" design example by [ApeWTF](https://penpot.app/penpothub/libraries-templates/mastodon-app)*

1. Create your ORIGIN color palette in either your local project library, or in some or your connected libraries, and create a group for your colors named as you wish (in this example the palette name is *Palette*):

2. Create your TARGET color palette in either your local project library, or in some or your connected libraries, and also group the colors with the name you want (in this example the palette name is *Complementary-Palette*):

- IMPORTANT NOTE: **The names of the colors in both the origin and target palette MUST BE THE SAME!, for example, if you have a color named "background" in your origin palette, you should have their counterpart color named "background" as well in your target palette, otherwise the colors will not be swapped.**

3. With the Plugin UI, select the library where your origin palette is located (your Local project library will be default named as *Local*):
